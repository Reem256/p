    <h3>In this page of the website, I've included some specific information about me.</h3>
    <h4>Who am I?</h4>

    <p>I’m Reem Abdelqadir Alyassi. I was born in 25 June 2004 and I'm 19 years old.<br>
        
        I’m a Junior Information Technology Multimedia student.
        I chose this major because I loved things related to computer science & graphic design since I was in high school, 
        I even took extra computer science courses back then because I really liked it, 
        and I knew that I would choose a major related to these subjects, 
        so IT MM was the best choice for me because it combines these two things that I love.
    </p>         
        <br>
    <p>I’m a person that loves art so much, and I love learning new things. <br> 
        I have a lot of hobbies, some of them are: swimming, badminton, ice skating, 
        drawing and painting even though I’m not good at it. Also, I love learning about different cultures, 
        specially from watching movies. And I would like to learn more about pottery and knitting.     
        I like spending time with my family and friends, trying new activities and exploring new places.
        But also, I value my time with myself, and I think sometimes I need a break from life and people.                                                                      
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>What do I stand for? <br>
        it’s a very important and beautiful question, because it reflects and represents a person's personality in a big way. 
        I stand for justice, truth and change, for the better of course. “change your life today, act now without delay”. 
        <br>
        When talking about change, I always think about the future, how my life will be and how will it change. 
        One of my goals after graduation is to search for a job that suits me and reflects my personality. 
        Also, I'm thinking about starting a small business before getting a job, to learn more working and business skills.  
        So these are my future plans and goals.
    </p>
